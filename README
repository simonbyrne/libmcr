LIBMCR
======
Included in this distribution of libmcr, Sun's correctly rounded
implementation of seven libm functions, are the source files necessary
to build the library, and test drivers to test the functions with
selected test vectors.

A top-level make is supplied to build both the library and the
test codes.  Information about configuration related modifications,
building the library and tests, and running the tests are included
later in this file.

A general algorithm description is supplied in the file

	./docs/overview

along with a formatted man page

	./docs/libmcr.man

that can be installed into your man environment.

libmcr is provided to the public under copyright protection.  The
copyright notice is include at the end of this file.

We would appreciate hearing from you if you have any comments, or
find any bugs in the code or have any issues with the algorithms used.
Send the TIMESTAMP information in the file "VERDATE" or the VERSION #
listed at the top of this file.

Build NOTES
===========
	gcc
	Care must be taken when compiling with gcc.  Certain optimization
	levels require additional flags be set.  The following list contains
	combinations that have been used.  The list is not exhaustive.

	SOLARIS
	Arch	gcc ver	Options			targets
	====	=======	=================	=======
	i386	all	-g			./src
	i386	2.95.3	-O -ffloat-store	./src
	i386	3.2.3	-O -ffloat-store	./src
	i386	3.3.2	-O -ffloat-store	./src
	i386		-O[23s]			./src
			-ffloat-store
			-no-strict-aliasing
	i386		-g			./tests

	sparc	all	-g			./src & ./tests
	sparc	all	-O			./src & ./tests
	sparc	2.95.3	-O[23s]			./src
			-fno-strict-aliasing
			-fno-gcse
			-fno-rerun-cse-after-loop

	LINUX
	Arch	gcc ver	Options			targets
	====	=======	=================	=======
	i386	3.2.2	-g			./src & ./tests
	i386	3.2.2	-O -fno-inline
			-ffloat-store
	i386	3.2.2	-O1 -fno-inline
			-ffloat-store

	NOTE:  compiling with options -O[23s]  result in Failures.
		Optimizations at this level are too aggressive.


File Modifications Before 1st Build
===================================

	Makefile
	========

	CC	: location of c compiler [default: cc]

	OPT	: optimization level [default: -g]

	CFLAGS	: compilation flags (default: ""]

		Note when using gcc, several flags are required.
		Refer to the Build Notes just above.

	
Building the library: libmcr.a
==============================

	make clobber
	make src


Building and running supplied tests
===================================

	make tests
	make runtests
